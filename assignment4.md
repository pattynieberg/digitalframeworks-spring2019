What does a country's investment in R&D mean on a global scale?

This story will look at percentage of GDP put towards a nation's research and deveopment. 
I will use data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, UNESCO and 
each country's finance, technology or innovation department. In order to compare them, I will also 
speak to economists, researchers, politicians who are involved in the field. Depending on the trends I 
begin to pick out, this will change my sources whether they are economists, policy experts or actual researchers.

Since my interest lies in Israel as the leading country with R&D as the greatest percentage of its GDP, I will contact politicians 
who have pushed for more R&D to hopefully get anecdotes on the role in Israel's economy.
This will be timely since the discussion for tech development and government participation in 
pushing these fields is constantly increasing. As Tel Aviv has become a leading tech hub, 
I hope to continue this work for my fellowship this summer in Israel. 

After narrowing down the focus, I will determine trends for how R&D affects the economy of each country, 
the government's intervention in business or perhaps compare the numbers how a nation ranks in terms of democracy. 
More research will be required to choose the path of what these numbers will mean when compared to other ratings.
