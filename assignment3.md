Here is my [edited data set](https://github.com/pattynieberg/digitalframeworks-spring2019/blob/master/R%26D_Country_Data.csv)

What I fixed:
* Rearranged the years into separate columns in order to better compare each country's yearly percentage to one another.
* Entered zeros for missing values. 
* Used proper names for each country to avoid confusion. 
* Cleaned up the formatting for clarity.
