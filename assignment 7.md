Science *is* Political According to FEC Donations

Since the beginning, the Trump administration causes a stir among the science community for controversial policies on 
climate change and stem cell research. So how much did the science community contribute to the 2016 elections?

According to FEC filings from 2015-2016, donors with the occupation "scientist" spent more money on Democrats in the 2016
election cycle, but pharmaceutical PACs contributed to the right with funds for Republicans and against Democrats.
Some of these larger PACs include:
1. *3M COMPANY PAC:* $183.1k for Republicans, $52K for Democrats 
2. *314 PAC:* $75.4K against Democrats
3. *ABBOT Laboratories Employee PAC:* 298.5K for Democrats, $376.1 for Republicans 
4. *ABBVIE PAC:* $385.3k Republicans, $304k Democrats

To analyze the data I structured a pivot table with the occupation which would give more details 
about the type of scientists, ie Mechanical, Chemsitry, Air Pollution, Food, etc which would give more context 
towards political leaning. 

I also looked at the groups with the largest scientific communities who donated which included Act Blue, Bernie 2016, Bennet For Colorado, , DCC and more. 
Most of the larger groups were Democratic PACs however like I mentioned, other groups contributed large amounts.
