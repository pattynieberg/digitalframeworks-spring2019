**Story Idea One**
How has the U.S. foreign assistance aid towards health changed over time?
*After briefly looking into the aid allocation towards health, I noticed that 
HIV/AIDS is still the leading category since 2011 at least from what I saw.
I'd like to go further in depth to look at the areas of the world, ie. Africa, 
Europe, South Asia, etc and see the trends of money and U.S. focus on certain issues.*

* Although this was overwhelming at first, it got the point accross and I knew to look for it in the article so it scores a 5 for me. 
* The only complaint I have was that it wasn't as interactive and could probably benefit from a hover option which gives more detail in a pop out box so 4.
* The source was another site which analyzes and projects data which they labeled and the numbers were sourced from the USAID, so 5.
* The quality was fine, it probably could take up a full page width to make it more appealing so 3.
* The first thing I noticed was the color coordination which was really appealing and helped give more information for the purpose of using a graphic. 
* It was clear to the viewer what colors represented which issue so 5.
* Since it didn't technically belong to MarketWatch and it was from another site, 4. But as for the entire thing -- I would love to create something similar. 

**Story Idea Two**
Why is there so much foreign lobbying money in relation to Liberia?
*This peaked my interest before we began the national security reporting project. 
I chose Liberia for its significant history with the U.S. in regards the civil war, 
slavery, etc. Since Liberia has had such a strong tie to the U.S., I wondered how our 
influence still exists in the country. In addition, Liberia being on the West Coast of 
Africa has meant a strategic position for U.S. Naval activity which I glanced at during
initial FARA reviews.*

* The data was displayed simply and effectively so 3. There wasn't much creativity to the graph.
* It was just an image and didn't have any interaction which I think always helps for boring charts and graphs so 2.
* The data was taken from OpenSecrets.com which is a trusted source so 5 for accuracy and sourcing.
* The data is limited to the top countries which takes away from understanding the countries with less lobbying money. But it did what it had to do so 3.
* The color was fine and not boring. It was clean and easy to look at which earns a 5 for me.
