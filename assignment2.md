Food Recalls over the last decade

 ------------ | -------------
 2018 | 125 | 49 | 28 | 19 
 2017 | 131 | 59 | 64 | 11 
 2016 | 122 | 54 | 45 | 21
 2015 | 150 | 33 | 69 | 35
 2014 |  94 | 21 | 46 | 17


By collecting this data I would like to see the change in food recalls over time. 
I would like to go back 50 years or so and look at the difference in the type of 
recalls. From my knowledge, the pesticide use and legal framework around food safety 
has changed so I'd like to explore that with this data. By looking at the breakdown of 
contamination, misbranding and inspection it may tell us more about the food system and 
whether the use of more chemicals and less regulation has affected the USDA's recalls. 
For this I used the USDA archive of recalls which I would also like to compare to food 
related deaths over time, changes in laws and the opinions of food science experts.
