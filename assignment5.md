Where has contraceptive use declined?  In which region of the world? Which countries?
As contraception use increased overall, many African countries actually had lower numbers of contraceptive use. Without being able to do the excel anaylsis, this is as in depth as I could go.

Which countries were excluded? There was no data from 2000-2019 for the following:
Aruba, Andorra, UAE, Antigua barbuda, Bahrain, Bermuda, Brunei, Central europe and baltic, Channel islands, Curacao, Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Domincia, Gibraltar, Greenland, 
Israel, Iceland, Lichiestein, Kosovo, Latvia, Luxembourg, St Martin, Macao (china), British virgin islands, French Polynesia, New Zeland, Monaco.

Who does this account for? Who doesnâ€™t the data account for?
The data is defined as: "Contraceptive prevalence rate is the percentage of women who are practicing, or whose sexual partners are practicing, any form of contraception. It is usually measured for women ages 15-49 who are married or in union."
Since sexual encounters outside of a formal union may be viewed negatively, the data is skewed to only represent married women or those who report uder those circumstances. It is also limited to ages 15-49 which is the ideal age range for having children. However, women obviously still engage in sexual encounters before and beyond this range.
